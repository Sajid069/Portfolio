        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm <strong>Md Sajid Hossain Khan</strong>, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student 
          at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET).
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working as a <strong>Software Engineer at BreakByte</strong>, where I'm developing 
          a website for the CUET IEEE Students Chapter using the MERN stack. I love building web applications 
          and solving problems with code.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise includes <strong>React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Python, Flutter</strong>, and more. 
          I've built projects ranging from HR management systems to e-commerce apps and even worked on 
          machine learning for sentiment analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy teaching - I've tutored over 50+ students in Math, Physics, Chemistry, and ICT!
        </p>
